## Welcome to my digital garden!

Hi, my name is Zhiyang and I am a computer science student at the National University of Singapore. At heart, I am a problem solver. The satisfaction of finding outside-of-the-box solutions has always fuelled my curiosity and drive. My passion for problem-solving led me to the field of computer science, where every line of code and algorithm presents a new challenge to conquer.

Here, you can browse through my experiences, cool projects, various writings, and digital illustrations (all the graphics on this site was designed by me!). I hope you enjoy your visit and feel free to connect with me on my socials!
